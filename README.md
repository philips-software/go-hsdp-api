# go-hsdp-api

A HSDP API client library enabling Go programs to interact with various HSDP APIs in a simple and uniform way

> [!Important]
> This library is not endorsed, supported or approved by HSDP. It is a Philips Open Source community managed project. Please do not raise
> SNOW tickets, instead open a issue on the [Github project](https://github.com/philips-software/go-hsdp-api/issues).

## Supported APIs
